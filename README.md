# First-Screening-Test---Smrithi-M



**PROCESS**

**Import the image**: I imported the image you sent into Figma and used it as a reference for the desktop layout.

**Analyze the design**: I studied the layout, typography, color scheme, and imagery of the original sections.

**Recreate the desktop layout**: I used Figma's vector drawing tools to recreate the shapes, text boxes, and icons in the original sections. I also matched the colors and fonts as closely as possible.

**Create mobile-responsive layouts**: I created separate layouts for each section that adapt to different screen sizes. I used Figma's auto layout features to ensure that the elements.

**Export the designs**: I exported the Figma designs as PNGs.


**Tool used**: Figma
